              A Montessori education offers children the opportunity to develop to their full potential as they
              grow into adults who are self-motivated and love learning,
              can think flexibly,
              and who are not only conscious of the needs of others but actively foster harmony as they go through life.
            </b-card-text>

            <b-card-text> Developed by Dr. Maria Montessori, the Montessori-method of education is a child-centered
               educational approach based on scientific observations of children from birth to adulthood.</b-card-text>

            <b-card-text> <b>“The education of even a very small child, therefore, does
                  not aim at preparing him for school, but for life.”</b></b-card-text>
